Create Artificial Neural Networks and make them really fast.

I'm a passionate Computer Vision researcher with 2+ years of experience. Deep
learning, applied machine learning programming and numerical calculations are
among the most common responsibilities in my projects.

I truly love to solve complex Computer Vision tasks with the Deep Learning
approaches and optimize pipelines for real-time inference.
