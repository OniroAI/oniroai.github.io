Currently a postdoc at the national research institute for mathematics and
informatics in the Netherlands (CWI Amsterdam) where I am developing computer
vision solutions for scientific imaging. I've got a PhD in Physics and my
aspiration is to reveal fundamental properties of the world through visual
data. At the moment, my primary interests are multidimensional data, inverse
problems and optimization theory. Outside of work, I like climbing, hiking and
beer.
