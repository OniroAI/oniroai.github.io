I work to bring Deep Learning solutions into sports and specialize in building
powerful lightweight Neural Networks for multi-task applications and optimizing
them for real-time implementation. I have 3+ years experience in the industry with
the main focus on solving problems of semantic segmentation, object-detection, OCR
and action recognition.

MSc in Materials Science, graduate of Lomonosov Moscow State University.
