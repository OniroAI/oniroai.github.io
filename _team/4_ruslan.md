Industrial and competitive Computer Vision and Audio tasks comprise my 6+ years of experience in a wide range of applications. For example, it includes leading the development of real-time video-based systems in sports analytics. In addition, implementing complex Deep Learning-based pipelines for both stages, training and inference, is at the center of my interest.
