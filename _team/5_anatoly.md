I am an MSc in Materials Science, graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University. I was deeply involved in research in the field of chemical thermodynamics, including experimental data acquisition, data analysis and model parameters optimisation by nonlinear regression. The findings are published in papers and conference theses (see [Istina](https://istina.msu.ru/profile/totoneutrino/) and [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57188752469) profiles).
My current interests include Android development for data collection automation and thermodynamics modeling. In addition, I'm implementing a mobile platform for sensor data collection at the team.
